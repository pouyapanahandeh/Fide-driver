In the Running_output.txt file you could see the response messages in the local webhook server while user message our facebook page.

In the beginning is the welcoming messages, showing the possible choices, and enquiry for the commands (1-4).

Up-to-here I implemented 2 properties, namely "Greetings" and "Authentication".

For the "Authentication", I have met the difficulty of transmitting data as input for the backhand image processing inputs and currently is working on it.

In the Running_output_fb.png file we can see the response from facebook chatbot. 

app.py file contains the defined functions, working language is python.
