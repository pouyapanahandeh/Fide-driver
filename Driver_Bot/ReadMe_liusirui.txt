Introduction:

This is the initial commit for the messenger chatbot of driver part. 

In the beginning we will show the welcoming messages, showing the possible choices, and enquiry for the commands (1-4).

Up-to-here I implemented 2 properties, namely "Greetings" and "Authentication".

For the "Authentication", I have met the difficulty of transmitting data as input for the backhand image processing inputs and currently is working on it.

The app.py file contains the defined functions, working language is python.
